<p>We often use coir footmats in our homes. Here’s an exhibition that takes this basic material to another level — with innovative designs in earrings, lamps, chandeliers, photo and mirror frames, mobile covers — all created from coir. The products are the result of a one month-long fellowship by Happy Hands Foundation where five youngsters worked with traditionally skilled craftspeople in Odisha to innovate together.   “The coir industry has been there for way too long without any innovation. We want to change that,” says Medhavi Gandhi, founder, Happy Hands Foundation, which is organising the exhibit as part of the Youth ACT Fellowship.  Most of the products are reasonably priced, starting at Rs. 50 for a pair of earrings to Rs. 1,500 for an elaborate chandelier. The show will also screen a 10-minute documentary on coir crafts made by one of the fellowship students — Swati Garg, 17, from Pune.</p>

<p>Medhavi set up the Happy Hands foundation to market lesser-known arts and crafts such as sujini, dhokra, cheriyal, bidri, jadu patua and sikki grass</p>
<p>At 22, Medhavi Gandhi dreamt of reviving India&#8217;s dying arts and crafts. Armed with an MBA degree, practically no capital and a blazing ambition to market and represent Indian artisans around the globe she started Happy Hands foundation. &#8220;At first, I did not even know how many types of arts or crafts our country had. As an intern for Unesco, when I interacted with the artisans to document their works, I could not resist the beauty and the legends attached with these crafts,&#8221; says the young entrepreneur. Three years later, her foundation is working with 800 artisan families and covers 25 clusters and villages across 12 states in India.</p>
<p>What motivated her to work on behalf of uneducated artists from various parts of rural India? &#8220;I could see simplicity and grace in a handmade product, a story waiting to be told, an art dying to be appreciated … I knew there was a large audience waiting to hear these stories.&#8221; Interestingly, for Medhavi, her first volunteers and customers were her friends and acquaintances who, unaware of our rich cultural heritage, were &#8220;too busy graduating or getting jobs&#8221;.</p>
<p>She travelled to villages to gather artisans. With no capital in hand, she had to convince them to lend her their artifacts, which she would later sell at a good price and soon enough they started trusting her. &#8220;People who could be of help were dismissive of the idea, of how 22-year olds could change a tradition; and education wasn&#8217;t even considered an issue. But for every one non-supportive person we met five supportive ones and that way I think I was lucky,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Today, Happy Hands foundation markets, arts and crafts as unique and unheard of as sujini, dhokra, cheriyal, bidri, jadu patua and sikki grass. They have reached out to youngsters and made them aware of India&#8217;s vast heritage. Medhavi explored and successfully introduced artisan products for corporate gifting. &#8220;Traditional art works speak of stories, customs and rituals but sadly year in and year out they spoke of the same episode from the Ramayana or the Mahabharata. Our cultural heritage, though vast, hardly saw representation in art,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>She drew inspiration from artists abroad. Her foundation is helping Indian artists imbibe more through international exchange programmes. &#8220;I see artists coming up with better designs and more so, I see the public accepting those designs,&#8221; says Gandhi. Many artisans have been inspired to set-up their own enterprises and sell their products online to international connoisseurs. Was it scary to start on her own at the tender age of 22? Pat comes the reply &#8220;The very age of 22 was the best thing about starting on my own. I had nothing to lose and at worst, my venture stood the risk of not working out. Then I had the Plan B of taking up a job but so as I never have to look at Plan B, I worked harder and harder and my to-do list grew longer,&#8221; she concludes.</p>

<p>Medhavi Gandhi was just 22 when she and two friends co-founded the Happy Hands Foundation, a Delhi-based non-profit dedicated to the revival and upkeep of the country’s indigenous art and craft, in 2009. The social entrepreneur credits a two-month internship with UNESCO for catapulting her into the crafts sector.</p>
<p>As a volunteer for the international agency’s Award of Excellence for Handicrafts (formerly known as the Seal of Excellence for Handicrafts) project in 2008, Gandhi documented the challenges faced by traditional artisans. She says it was the hands-on nature of the apprenticeship that prompted the Happy Hands Foundation’s cluster development, livelihoods training and marketing initiatives. The NGO also organizes artist residencies, public workshops and bazaars.</p>
<p>At 26, the MBA graduate, who set up the foundation with Mansi Joshi and Suneera Tandon (of Mint), hopes to come full circle by conducting a month-long fellowship designed to sensitize urban teenagers to rural craft communities. The first edition of the Happy Hands Foundation’s Youth Arts, Community and Transformation (ACT) Fellowship is centred on the coir crafts of Orissa.</p>
<p>The three-step training programme is open to 17- to 20-year-olds who have cleared their class XII examinations. Participants will begin with a week-long orientation in New Delhi, followed by two weeks of rural outreach in Satasankha village, near Puri, and a final week of documentation and assessment back in the Capital.</p>
<p>According to Gandhi, the coir toys of Orissa are among the more neglected craft forms, with hackneyed designs of animals and birds that haven’t changed with the times. Since there is ample scope for product development, the participants will first learn to make coir artefacts from scratch.</p>
<p>Meeta and Sunny Narang of the Delhi-based Bindass Unlimited collective, responsible for many of the rejigged traditional handicrafts at stores like Either Or in Pune and People Tree in Delhi, will conduct craft sessions and skills-set training. Gandhi will also impart lessons on community building, breaking barriers and overcoming rural stereotypes.</p>
<p>In Satasankha, programme manager, education, Deepti Singh will encourage the volunteers to conduct a needs-based assessment of the craft cluster. Participants can then choose to collaborate with local artists on new designs or teach them to use digital cameras, computers, Internet, social media and online marketing. “They (the volunteers) will be tying up a lot of loose ends for the cluster so that it learns to become independent,” explains Gandhi. They will also be expected to document the whole project and mobilize other communities in and around the village to participate in their activities, Gandhi adds.</p>
<p>At the end of the trip, a small exhibition based on their continuous documentation and progress will be organized for friends and family. Sunny will also help the participants decide on whether they want to continue working with the cluster, and in what capacity, after the fellowship. In case the participants are willing to commit to the cause, the Happy Hands Foundation will help them build a business model to market coir products and even raise funds.</p>
<p>At present, the fellowship is only open to 8-10 participants, but Gandhi says funds raised from applications and new sponsorships may allow them to expand.</p>

<p><strong>A Delhi-based NGO&#8217;s residency programme for rural artistes is helping them create contemporary products using Indian crafts &#8211;<br />
</strong><br />
At a time when the world is endorsing desi chic as their design mantra, Indian artistes too are striving hard to take Indian craft beyond wall hangings and drawing-room furnishings. And by conceptualising a month-long residency programme for rural Indian artistes, a Delhi-based NGO is helping them to do just that. Medhavi Gandhi of the Happy Hands Foundation has been working on creating artiste-oriented platforms for a few years now, and her latest is an initiative named The People&#8217;s Project Studio &#8211; which is a platform to help rural artistes tap contemporary markets, while also innovating on their craft.</p>
<p>The studio is currently running a 25-day residency programme for four artistes at Saidulajab, where they are being exposed to ideas of design, pricing and packaging. At the end of the residency, the products that the artistes create will be put on sale. Says Gitanjali Kumar, who&#8217;s working with the artistes, &#8220;Lack of relevant exposure results in the craft of these artistes getting endangered. Through this residency, we intend to introduce them to various ideas, and we&#8217;re also having designers, design students as well as other mentors work with them. In turn, these artistes take weekend classes too, where the general public can learn their craft. We have four artistes &#8211; Radha Sullur, who specializes in Karanataka&#8217;s Chittara art, D Padma for Andhra Pradesh&#8217;s Cherial art, Heera Devi for Bihar&#8217;s Madhubani art, and Sebati Swain for Orissa&#8217;s Soara tribal painting. People can come and attend weekend classes with them for a nominal fee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, the artistes are creating many innovative products including apparel, accessories, games, home decor items, and stationery, and by helping them price the products well for the young consumer, the NGO hopes to be able to make them self sufficient in the long run.</p>

<p>It was while interning with UNESCO in Delhi in 2009 that Medhavi Gandhi came in touch with artisans from across the country. During her interaction with them, she realised what they lacked was a dedicated space, a market where they could showcase their talent. &#8220;In the presence of cheaper market substitutes, the handcrafted products do not attract too many buyers,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>That is when she decided to take it forward and founded Happy Hands Foundation, a non-profit organisation that tries to empower artisans and revive their art and cultural traditions. &#8220;At Happy Hands, the focus is to provide sustainable development opportunities for craftsmen and encourage them to live a life of dignity. India is defined by its traditional arts and crafts, we can&#8217;t afford to lose them as it would mean losing an important part of our culture,&#8221; says the 24-year-old who chose to work with artisans after completing her MBA from Pune.</p>
<p>Happy Hands conducts workshops with artisans where they are taught design intervention. &#8220;At the workshops, our focus is to encourage them do things differently and innovate to give a modern touch to their designs,&#8221; says Gandhi. Apart from holding workshops in Delhi, she also holds sessions in other states. The products made by the artisans are displayed at various exhibitions held at malls and also at The People&#8217;s Project, a store in Hauz Khas&#8211;an initiative of Happy Hands that opened about a month ago.</p>
<p>At the store, one can find products from different parts of India like cherial paintings from Andhra, pottery from Rajasthan, bamboo products, crafted apparel, home-décor items, jewellery, bags, stationery and a lot of other gift items. &#8220;The prices start from Rs 40 and go up to about Rs 5,000. This initiative for development of the craftsmen allows students, young people and artists to be collaborative and innovate. It follows a do-it-yourself approach wherein the consumers, apart from buying the product, can also learn and create. If they have any design ideas that will help innovate rural art forms, they are welcome to share them with us,&#8221; says Gandhi.</p>
<p>“ Do-it-yourself approach is a good concept as there are so many young, talented people around who have just passed out of college and have some great design ideas. If they are really passionate about art and can help us in taking this further, they can work with us. It is a good platform for the upcoming designers,” says Sanchita Jain, a graphic designer and a member of Happy Hands.</p>
<p>Apart from conducting design workshops and exhibitions, Happy Hands Foundation has another project&#8211;DOR that aims to empower underprivileged women and make them self-reliant by teaching them basic design skills and product development techniques. The classes are held in Dakshinpuri in South Delhi every Saturday between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.</p>
<p>With financial support from a few corporates, the organisation is constantly widening its scope. Last month, it held a workshop&#8211;&#8216;Brush, Botal aur Batti&#8217;&#8211;at its Hauz Khas store where people got to paint on beer bottles and learn the art of street painting from a billboard painter from old Delhi.</p>

<p>In October last year, a potter and a group of students fashioned a ten-foot terracotta sculpture decorated with striking Warli motifs. A culmination of a skill-sharing workshop that they’d had with  the students created their own renditions of this ancient folk art, infusing it with new energy. But what made the sculpture truly piquant was that it was of a  The Warli-embellished bottle of Coke represents what the organisers, the  hope to accomplish — the revival of Indian folk art and craft forms through contemporary ways. Coke used this sculpture in their advertising which I’d seen, so when I learnt that Happy Hands was organising another workshop – this time with a Madhubani artist – I was keen to see what would come out of it.</p>
<p>“The idea of bringing people my age closer to Indian crafts came to me one day when I was getting really bored in my MBA class on  in Pune,” said , one of the spunky young women who started Happy Hands about two years ago. “I believed that if more students in urban settings actually tried their hands at these crafts, they’d appreciate them better,” she added. Also, she’d observed that the lack of market access and poor exposure to fresh ideas were causing creative stagnation amongst traditional artisans. “My friends and I’ve stopped shopping at Dilli Haat since it has the same old craftspeople selling the same old things!” she said. That is why two years ago, Gandhi, with journalist friend Suneera and designer Sanchita started Happy Hands.</p>
<p>Their first concern was to enable craftspeople across the country to make products more interesting to modern consumers. Gandhi travelled to craft clusters across the country, looking for craftspeople open to innovating traditional skills. “We now sell many of their products online through our website, and are soon going to open a store where people can learn a little about the crafts they buy,” she said. They also sell through regular exhibitions across the country. “We’d like to provide the craftspeople who work with us as many commercial avenues as we can,” Gandhi explained.</p>
<p>Their focus then shifted to training students. “We felt training workshops could enable students to understand the aesthetics and intricacy of crafts better,” she said. So, the Madhubani workshop held last week at the National Institute of Fashion Technology Delhi saw established artist  teaching the NIFT students the basics of the Madhubani art. They created a 6&#215;4 foot scroll (foldable into a booklet) entitled Capital’D to commemorate 100 years of Delhi as a capital city. It was divided into smaller squares, each embellished with the borders that Madhubani paintings are known for. Inside each square was a student’s representation of an icon symbolic of the capital. One square contained an autorickshaw, another featured India Gate while a third immortalised a traffic jam. “I helped the students draw these icons, so that they’d be in keeping with the Madhubani style,” explained Heera Kanth, the artist conducting the workshop.</p>
<p>“It was challenging,” she said, showing me her piquant folk rendition of a CNG autorickshaw, “I’ve never sketched such designs before!” “I’m sure this experience will show in my new creative efforts,” she added. As I watched the students lounging on the sunny terrace, painting shoulder-to-shoulder with Heera Kanth, I felt as though I were witnessing the birth of something too familiar to be new. Was an age-old art tradition getting contemporised or modern artistic sensibilities getting influenced by older techniques? The boundaries were rather blurred on the scroll — all I could see were a dozen happy hands.</p>
