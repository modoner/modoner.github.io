<p style="text-align: center;">On occasion of The World Environment Day, we at the People&#8217;s Project decided to get people of Delhi hooked onto an observation-based social media game.</p>
<p>We have set up a 5 day long hunt &#8211; and believe us, it&#8217;s not an ordinary one! This one will get your phone&#8217;s heart racing, and you might just be able to catch a glimpse of some traditional arts and crafts.</p>
<p>So what is this hunt about? This Environment Day we all plan to play a game where you complete our words – literally!</p>
<p>Step 1: SPOT IT!</p>
<p>Dilliwalas! It is time to heighten your sense of vision and spot letters around you. So we suggest you keep your eyes wide open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: CLICK IT!</p>
<p>So you spot the alphabet and pick up your phone camera and click a picture!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: SHARE IT!</p>
<p>They say Sharing is Caring… so share that pretty picture with everyone you care about on facebook. Just tag us OR tweet it with #DCodeGreen.</p>
<p>We add your picture to build the word for the day and complete the phrase to spread awareness about the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4: GO BACK TO STEP 1!</p>
<p>We have so many alphabets to capture, so many words to complete and so many days… We better keep spotting, clicking and sharing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be a part of the very first Delhi Word Hunt!</p>
<p>Go D-Coding Dilli…Get Set Go!</p>

<p>People ate, people drank, people smoked &#8211; and let the monument keep memorabilia of their indulgence &#8211; in bulk!</p>
<p>We decided to clean up, but we also decided to indicate what the monument really looked like when people left.</p>

<p>On December 12, 1911 the British moved from Calcutta to the city of Delhi, declaring it as the capital. Ever since then, Delhi has garbed many different roles. From being Dilwalon ki Dilli, to a heartless city, from being the haven of leaders to being the companion of the homeless, the city has something in store for everyone.</p>
<p>This year as Delhi turns 100, we at The People’s Project seek to celebrate the magnanimity of this dynamic city through a series of art &amp; craft related workshops.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kite-Making has been a popular form of public engagement during the time of the Maharajas, and sadly today, has been reduced to a mere activity usually centered around Independence Day. Kite-Wars, designer kites, etc, are now unheard of.</p>
<p>The People&#8217;s Project, in association with Nimbooz, invites artists and design enthusiasts from the city to conjecture Graphic Kites- the first ever of their kind, as illustrating on kite-paper is not an easy task. Our noted kite-maker Umer Daraj will be hosting the workshop, followed by an installation-exhibition of the designed kites, which would be judged by an eminent Jury. The winning kites, would feature in Creative Gaga-the design magazine.</p>
<p>Our Special Feature is a WORLD MUSIC CONCERT by the Tarun Balani Collective. Drummer/Percussionist and Composer Tarun Balani , brings together a collective of artistes/musicians to create a sound palette beyond limitations. An evening of Art and Music &#8212; it really can&#8217;t get better.</p>

<p>Going by what Paul Rand says- “The problem of the artist is to make the commonplace uncommonplace” we at The People’s Project have decided to do our bit to emphasize the father-of-all-problems-facing-humanity called Climate Change. And keeping up with the coming Earth Hour, we have decided to do a small public intervention leading up to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When objects are taken out of their natural habitat, they are much more noticeable. So we thought…why not take the good old power switches out of their usual sockets and place them where you will definitely not expect them to be. If you find one on your way and are willing to switch it off, we hope you might go back home and do the same, day-by-day, everyday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We invite artists, activists, enthusiasts, pranksters, photographers and all those who are willing to make this Earth Hour the most successful one ever on world soil. Not just by switching off on 26th, but by spreading awareness with some effective action (and reaction)!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
