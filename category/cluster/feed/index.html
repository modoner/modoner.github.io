				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To feel like an artist, is to feel liberated. The sense of freedom that engulfs an artist can never be traded for a few cents more. Which is why, it was so important for us to work with the women of Kathputli Colony in Shadipur, New Delhi. The colony is a resettlement of Rajasthani- artists who practice puppetry, folk dances, and other crafts. Many non-profits / student groups, have worked here, and continue to do so. The colony is very well-known for the puppeteers it is home to, and especially, Puran Bhat, who is a well-travelled, talented puppeteer. The puppet shows emerging from Shadipur have spoken about child-labour, sexual abuse, health and sanitation, gender violence, women&#8217;s rights, etc. While we were impressed by the stories and effective plays, somewhere, deep down, we missed the voice of women in these stories.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to do what you think you want to do, women would be entering this space after 400 years&#8221;, commented Puran Bhat when we got him on board for the skills-training.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jyoti.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3456" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jyoti-300x225.png" alt="Jyoti" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Our group comprises of women young and old. Their stories &#8211; they range from rights-based themes to fantasy. In the past couple of months, they have learnt how to make puppets right from scratch. They&#8217;ve learnt what used to be the &#8220;man&#8217;s job&#8221; &#8211; carving, shaping, and painting. Of course, they always knew how to make clothes for the puppets, but this time around, women dedicated themselves to understanding how a puppeteering group would function as an Enterprise. While they learn how to design and create sets, they simultaneously work on a marketing plan for their play. Who would sponsor them? Where would they conduct the plays? Who is their potential audience? These are just some of the questions they ask in class, but end up answering themselves.</p>
<p>In our journey, which we continue with the women, we have been graciously supported by British Council India, DIAGEO, and most importantly, the MEN of Kathputli Colony.</p>
<p>Often we feel, gender equality is understood as giving women the same space as men. This project on another level, helped us understand that gender equality is creating a space where men and women not only work together, but work with mutual admiration, and in close collaboration.</p>
<p>Jyoti&#8217;s story (picture attached), is just one of those glimpses into a marital relationship, where there&#8217;s new found meaning to &#8220;supporting one another&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3175" title="The village of Nakuliya" alt="Nakuliya_Fotor" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Nakuliya_Fotor1-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></p>
<p>The Rana Tharu is a tribal community settled in the Terai and Bhabar region of Uttarakhand, now the district of Udham Singh Nagar.<b> </b>The Tharus lead a very simple life revolving around agricultural work. In today’s day and time, it is encouraging to observe that among Tharus the women hold a higher position not only in the case of work volume but also in the case of decision making. Recently the community has been fully recognized for its unique crafts made of local grasses in the area. The women use a variety of locally available natural grasses such as Seenk, Moonj, Kansi, Pateri, Gondi, Motha etc. to develop baskets with intricate motifs, vibrant colours and patterns. Primarily a cultural practice with the highly decorated baskets being given to daughters in marriages, today the Tharu community is diversifying into making basketry-based handicrafts for sale, in order to supplement their income from other sources and increase their ability to withstand fluctuations in income at different times of the year.</p>
<p>While the Tharu women are extremely motivated and hard &#8211; working, they tend to be a little shy. So it has been very courageous of Amrawati, to take the first step, and organise the women into a Co-operative. When you ask her what motivates her in turn, her response is endearing, and reminds us of the simple joys of life : “We are a community of farm labourers. For 100/- a day, we work at other peoples’ farms, or construction sites. It is so hard to toil in the sun all day. I decided to forego the earning per day, and decided to sit in the shade of my home to weave baskets. I sold some, and earned almost as much as I would have on the farm. Seeing me, a lot of women started coming to my home to sit with me, and weave…”</p>
<p>And thus began the journey of Amrawati, and her group of wonder-women!</p>
<p>This year, we at Happy Hands Foundation are proud to associate with the Rana Tharu community and look forward to building an enterprise with them &#8211; so they can continue to grow and prosper, in the shade that motivates them so much!</p>
<p>Part I: Enterprise Training:</p>
<p>Over a week, we worked with 50 women of the community, to streamline their co-operative and establish best practices which would enable them to reach their craft to a wider audience in the village, and outside.</p>
<p>We began by having the women analyse their current working model based on the MAIR framework. It was imperative in the beginning to establish the importance of a social enterprise, and even more important to draw their attention to the most important elements of a business which sustain it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3163" title="Kiran involving the women in analysing different aspects of their enterprise! " alt="Kiran (MAIR)" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Kiran-MAIR-300x214.jpg" width="300" height="214" /></p>
<p>The next part of our training was challenging &#8211; we had to explain costing and pricing to a group of women, of which hardly 8 were literate! While they understood the concepts, they could hardly translate their calculations to paper. But the women, enterprising as their spirit is, chose to endeavour to form groups and lead the activity.</p>
<p>The good thing that emerged of this was, that the women chose to stick to groups, and learnt and moved ahead &#8211; together.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panorama_Fotor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3176" title="Working in groups, moving ahead TOGETHER" alt="Panorama_Fotor" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panorama_Fotor-300x82.jpg" width="300" height="82" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, once the activity was underway, it brought the most disappointing look to the women’s faces &#8211; they had suddenly discovered that they had been making losses all along, by under-pricing their products!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3165" title="The look of disappointment!" alt="Disappointed_Fotor_Fotor" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Disappointed_Fotor_Fotor-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></p>
<p>This further inspired them to work harder during the training.</p>
<p>But like they say, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.</p>
<p>The Marketing Game we played had the women hooked on for an entire day! In teams, they challenged each other to learn better, and came up with some of the most interesting strategies for marketing their products!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3166" title="Playing the Marketing Game" alt="WP_20140513_16_10_05_Pro_Fotor" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WP_20140513_16_10_05_Pro_Fotor-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></p>
<p>Over the next few days, the women crafted their Business Plan, focusing on all the elements necessary &#8211; customer relations, branding, product line development, etc. and structured their organisation according to functions while taking full responsibility for the tasks to be undertaken. They even drafted their own brand identity, and announced the beginning of “Rana Grass Product” [ drumroll + loud applause ] !!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3167" title="Drafting the Business Canvas" alt="BusinessPlan" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BusinessPlan-300x157.jpg" width="300" height="157" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3168" title="The Identity! " alt="Identity_Fotor" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Identity_Fotor-300x261.jpg" width="300" height="261" />As a mentor to them, we felt most happy when the group leaders presented their action plans  on the last day- it was a moment of great pride for the women as well us us &#8211; the direction the women seem to have chosen was clear now, and their determination to succeed was heart-warming!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3169" title="Final Presentations :)" alt="WP_20140514_10_28_52_Pro_Fotor" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WP_20140514_10_28_52_Pro_Fotor-300x171.jpg" width="300" height="171" /></p>
<p>To applaud their efforts, and recognise each individual’s contribution to the workshop, we gifted women with Sarees (generously contributed by Tribhuvan Das Jewellers) &#8211; and one of them quipped, “Now we know what it feels like to go to school and receive a prize!”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3170" title="With a lot of learning and love.." alt="Last shot_Fotor" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Last-shot_Fotor-300x148.jpg" width="300" height="148" /></p>
<p>On a more retrospective note, the “prize” is definitely the feeling we retained as we came back from the humble village of Nakuliya &#8211; a lot more loved, and a lot more energetic.</p>
<p>We are grateful to our donors for the training &#8211; British Council India and DIAGEO who felt this project was worthy of being included in the <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/british-council-partner-zone/gender-equality-india-improved-social-enterprise" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Young Women’s Social Entrepreneurship initiative</span></a></span></em> that they have undertaken this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3173" title="Amrawati and the Wonder-Women" alt="Women_Fotor_Collage" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Women_Fotor_Collage-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /> And because all good things must never come to an end, we will continue updating you on the lovely Rana Tharu women as we continue working with them through this year. Until next time..</p>

			<p>Jharkhand is home to many beautiful crafts, and tribals struggling to preserve their culture. While several initiatives have helped some of the crafts to gain prominence, other crafts such as Soapstone carving dwell in anonymity.</p>
<p>On way to a small tribal village in Potka district, we learnt of many stories, and tribal traditions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3118" alt="Pots in the House" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Pots-in-the-House-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" /></p>
<p>Tribals hang earthen pots outside their homes, in the hope for a visit by birds (especially pigeons). It is believed that birds only nest in houses that are &#8216;peaceful&#8217; and happy.</p>
<p>As we entered the village, beautiful homes and eager-to-meet tribals welcomed us.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3120" alt="Entrance to Kadal" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Entrance-to-Kadal2-300x196.jpg" width="300" height="196" /><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3121" alt="Homes" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Homes-286x300.jpg" width="286" height="300" /></p>
<p>On asking, they showed us the soapstone-carved objects they have been making since time immemorial. These include : bowls, plates, diya-holders and agarbatti stands. They end up selling these at the local railway-station for as little as ₹30-40/-</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3122" alt="Basket of Products" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Basket-of-Products-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We tribals need money everyday, which is why we go to the station to sell these. Who else would sell it for us?&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3123" alt="Vijay_Fotor" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Vijay_Fotor-168x300.jpg" width="168" height="300" /></p>
<p>Vijay, is an artisan belonging to the Korga tribe. He works from 7:00 am to 4:00 pm and earns an average of ₹1500/- a month.</p>
<div id="attachment_3124" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3124" alt="A finished, soapstone carved bowl." src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Bowl-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A finished, soapstone carved bowl.</p></div>
<p>The villagers don&#8217;t rely on any other mode of income &#8211; they source their stone for free from the nearby forests (requesting the guards to let them go), and struggle all day to make these. Elderly women and children in the village assist with only daily chores such as cooking and cleaning.</p>
<div id="attachment_3125" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3125" alt="A tribal woman selling the objects at the railway station." src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fotor_altAscFkSIx7CCdApsdlCIlLGcz87YUHrc83SELc7TowlWq-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A tribal woman selling the objects at the railway station.</p></div>
<p>Incidentally, on way back from the village, we did run into a tribal woman, Sarla, selling these objects.</p>
<p>In another village, not so far from Kadal, we met some artisans who traditionally make baskets. When we asked how much they were priced at, the response was : &#8220;3 kgs of Rice&#8230;And the big one for 5 kgs of Rice..&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_3126" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3126  " alt="BambooWeaving_Fotor" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BambooWeaving_Fotor-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Preparing the Bamboo Strips</p></div>
<div id="attachment_3127" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3127 " alt="Weaving the Basket" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Basket-Weaving_Fotor-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Weaving the Basket</p></div>
<div id="attachment_3128" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3128" alt="Different Baskets" src="http://happyhands.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Baskets_Fotor-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Different Baskets</p></div>
<p>We look forward to working in Jharkhand in 2014, and come back with new stories. Until next time &#8230;</p>
